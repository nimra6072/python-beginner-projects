**Description**:
The "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game is a simple Python project that allows you to play the classic hand game against a computer opponent. The game follows these basic rules:

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The user and the computer each choose one of these three options, and the winner is determined based on the rules. The game provides feedback on the outcome of each round and allows the user to quit at any time.

**Usage**:
1. Run the Python script in your Python environment.

2. The game will welcome you and prompt you to make a choice by typing "rock," "paper," or "scissors." You can also type "q" to quit the game.

3. After making your choice, the computer will randomly select its choice.

4. The program will then announce the result of the round, indicating whether you won, lost, or if it's a tie.

5. You can continue playing rounds or type "q" to quit the game.

6. The game continues until you decide to quit.

This project is a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming and can be customized and expanded in various ways. You can enhance it by adding a score system, a more user-friendly interface, or even creating a graphical version of the game using a library like Pygame if you want to take it to the next level.
